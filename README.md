# **FawryPay iOS SDK**

Accept popular payment methods with a single client-side implementation.

## **Before You Start**

Use this integration if you want your iOS application to:

-   Accepts cards and other payment methods.
-   Saves and displays cards for reuse.

Make sure you have an active FawryPay account, or [**create an account**](https://atfawry.fawrystaging.com/merchant/register).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

On this page we will walk you through iOS SDK integration steps:

1.  Installing FawryPaySDK Pod.
2.  Initialize and Configure FawryPay iOS SDK.
3.  Override the SDK colors.
4.  Present Payment options.
5.  Return payment processing information and inform your client with the payment result.

## **Step 1: Installing FawryPaySDK Pod**

This document illustrates how our gateway can be integrated within your iOS application in simple and easy steps. Please follow the steps in order to integrate the FawryPay iOS SDK in your application.

1.  Create a pod file in your application if it doesn't exist. Using this [Cocoapod Guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html)
2.  Add in your pod file and make sure you are using our (2.0.2) [Latest Version](https://github.com/FawryPay/iOS-Fawrypay-Anonymous-sample/tags)

<!-- -->

    pod 'FawryPaySDK'

3.  Add the following code at the end of the pod file :<br>

<!-- -->

    post_install do |installer|  
        installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|    
            target.build_configurations.each do |config|      
                config.build_settings['BUILD_LIBRARY_FOR_DISTRIBUTION'] = 'YES'    
            end  
        end
    end

4.  Open terminal navigated to your project root folder
5.  Run pod install

## **Step 2: Initialize FawryPay IOS SDK**

1.  Import FawryPay SDK in your Swift file.

``` swift
import FawryPaySDK
```

2.  Create an instance of
    -   LaunchCustomerModel
    -   LaunchMerchantModel
    -   ChargeItemsParamsModel
    -   FawryLaunchModel
    -   Accounts model
    -   checkoutModel

and pass the required parameters (Required andoptional parameters are determined below).

**Notes:**

-   **you can pass either signature or secureKey (in this case we will create the signature internally), knowing that if the 2 parameters are passed the secureKey will be ignored and the signature will be used.**

-   You can use below code snippet to show the receipt after payment is done or skip the user input screen while providing mobile and email instead of getting input from the user by setting the configurations **skipCustomerInput** and **skipReceipt** under FawryLaunchModel (Both configurations have a default value of **true** ).

    -   **fawryLaunchModelObject. skipCustomerInput = true**

    -   **fawryLaunchModelObject. skipReceipt = false**

b.  Card Manager Mode: Call launchCardManager from the shared instance of FrameworkHelper and the payment screen will launch.

## **Step 3: Override the SDK colors**

1.  Add a plist file to your project named "Style".
2.  Add keys named:

-   primaryColorHex
-   secondaryColorHex
-   tertiaryColorHex
-   headerColorHex

3.  Give the keys values of your preferred hex color codes

## **Payment Flows:**

**We have 2 payment flows:**

1.  Payment with card details, in which we take the card details (card number, cvv, expiry date) in the payment screen and then we handle the payment.
2.  Payment with card token, in which we have 2 screens, first one manages cards which includes (add, delete, retrieve) for cards and the cards are saved and connected to the customerProfileId parameter that you pass in the initialization. And the second screen is the normal payment screen.

To choose which flow you want to start with there is a **paymentWithCardToken** flag in the initialization of the **FawryLaunchModel**.

**So if this flag is true you will need to pass** **customerProfileId** **to be able to complete a payment with its corresponding cards and if the** **customerProfileId** **doesn't have saved cards, when the user choose to pay with credit card we would ask him to click a button to navigate him to add card screen and after adding it successfully he will be redirected automatically to the payment screen to continue the payment flow. And in case the user wanted to delete or check which cards he saved or add a new card without opening the payment screen he can start the flow called launchCardManager as determined in step 2.**

## **Callbacks Explanation:**

-   **launchAnonymousSDK:**\
    There are 5 callbacks:
    -   **completionBlock: { FawrySDKStatusCode? in }**\
        called when flow launched successfully.

    -   **onPreCompletionHandler: { FawryError? in }**\
        called when flow NOT launched.

    -   **errorBlock: { FawryError? in }**

        -   if you enabled the receipt and payment failed, this callback will be called after clicking the done button in the receipt.

        -   if you disabled the receipt and payment failed, this callback will be called upon the finish of the payment screen.

    -   **onPaymentCompletedHandler: { Any ? in }**\
        will be called only whether the payment passed or not. And it's called upon receiving the response of the payment either success or fail.

    -   **onSuccessHandler: {Any ? in }**

        -   if you enabled the receipt and payment succeeded, this callback will be called after clicking the done button in the receipt.

        -   if you disabled the receipt and payment succeeded, this callback will be called upon the finish of the payment screen and the success of the payment.
            
-   **launchCardManager:**\
    There are 3 callbacks:
    -   **errorBlock: { FawryError? in }**\
        if an error happened.

    -   **onAddedNewCard: { SavedCard in }**\
        when adding cards successfully.

    -   **dismissBlock: { }**\
        unused in this flow
